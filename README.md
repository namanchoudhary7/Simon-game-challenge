üéÆ Simon Game Challenge

üí° Overview

This is a digital recreation of the classic electronic memory game, Simon. The project challenges players to repeat a progressively longer and faster sequence of lights and sounds. It was primarily built to demonstrate proficiency in core front-end web development concepts.

This game is a fantastic way to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and complex game logic using JavaScript.

üöÄ Key Features
Progressive Difficulty: The sequence increases by one step with each successful round.

Visual and Audio Feedback: Each colored button flashes and plays a unique tone when pressed by the computer or the player.

Game Over State: A clear "Game Over" screen and sound are displayed upon an incorrect input.

User Interface: A simple, four-button interface with a clear level indicator.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

Technology       Purpose
HTML5            Defines the structure of the game board and display elements.
CSS3             "Provides all the styling, layout, and visual feedback (e.g., the ""pressed"" animation effect)."
JavaScript       "Handles the core game logic: generating random sequences, managing turns, checking user input against the pattern, and controlling all sound and visual effects."

üïπÔ∏è How to Play
Launch the Game: Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Start: Press any key on your keyboard to begin. The level indicator will change to "Level 1."

Memorize the Pattern: The game will show you a sequence by flashing the colored buttons and playing their corresponding sounds.

Repeat the Sequence: Click the buttons in the exact order you saw them.

Advance Level: If you are correct, the level will increase, and the game will present the old sequence plus one new random step.

Game Over: If you click a button out of sequence, the game ends. Press any key to start a new game from Level 1.
